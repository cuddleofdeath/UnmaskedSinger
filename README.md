# Unmasked Singer is a project being created for the Hasura Hackathon (from March 1st to March 31st, 2022) by CuddleofDeath

This is a fun web app that will allow you to view information about Masked Singer (USA) contestants.

# The plan

I plan on building this app with:

- Hasura for GraphQL APIs
- Heroku for database (using Hasura)
- Apollo Client
- ReactJS

and other dependencies. I will update this README overtime with more information.

For now, consider this the beginning of my project.

# The goal

The goal is to complete the hackathon with a functioning project where the user can browse Masked Singer data in a fun way!
